This repo provides Docker containers to provide directly test the [crisp_controllers](https://github.com/utiasDSL/crisp_controllers) with real hardware or in simulation with a simple [MuJoCo](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco) `ros2_control` interface provided in this repository.

## Available demos
For now, these are the available demos in this repository. New demos are welcome, in particular if tested with real hardware.
Some other manipulators that couldd be added to this list is the ![Open Manipulator](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/open_manipulator) or other dual setups.

| Robots | Franka Robotics FR3 | FR Dual FR3 | IIWA 14 | Kinova Gen3 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| MuJoCo simulated Hardware | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Real Hardware | ✅ | ✅ | ❔[^1]  | ❔[^1] |

[^1]: Untested, but effort interface available.

## Getting started


0. (TEMPORARY) Clone the crisp controllers to the repo (later it will be part of the Dockerfile)
```bash
git clone git@github.com:utiasDSL/crisp_controllers_demos.git crisp_controllers_demos
cd crisp_controllers_demos
git clone git@github.com:utiasDSL/crisp_controllers.git crisp_controllers
git clone git@github.com:danielsanjosepro/franka_force_feedback_controllers.git franka_force_feedback_controllers  # In order to use the haptic feedback control with franka
```

> [!WARNING]
> Do NOT use **Docker Desktop**. Just go for the normal Docker CLI.

1. Build and start the provided container.
```bash
docker compose build
```
2. Start your robot:
```bash
docker compose up launch_iiwa
```
or
```bash
LEFT_ROBOT_IP=172.16.1.2 RIGHT_ROBOT_IP=172.16.0.2 FRANKA_FAKE_HARDWARE=true docker compose up launch_dual_franka
```
or
```bash
ROBOT_IP=172.16.0.2 FRANKA_FAKE_HARDWARE=true docker compose up launch_franka
```
or
```bash
docker compose up launch_kinova
```

3. Now you can publish to `/target_joint` or `/target_pose`! Check [crisp_py](https://github.com/utiasDSL/crisp_py) examples to see how to easily use it.

> [!WARNING]  
> If you work in different machines (using [crisp_py](https://github.com/utiasDSL/crisp_py) or others) you might want to consider using zenoh as you ROS middleware.
> Simply use the cyclone version: `launch_franka_zenoh` or `launch_dual_franka_zenoh` and setup the ip address of the router of your machine in the setup file.

## Troubleshooting

### The robot is not moving and it vibrates when I try to command it. Why?
> Probably, you have multiple nodes publishing to `target_pose`. You might not have killed them properly
> Running `ros2 node list` will show you if some nodes run in the background and if you see multiple instances of a node you might have this problem.
> Run `pkill -9 -f ros && ros2 daemon stop` to kill unwanted nodes and try again.

### Rviz does not open when launch the robots. Why?
> Simply run `xhost +` on a terminal to enable any host to use the X. You need this because we are running the demos in a container.

### When executing `ros2 topic list` in a different terminal, I can not see any topics. However, the container is running. Why?
> Probably you are using a different `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`. The default now is set to 100 but you can change it when running the container. To change it in your shell run `export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=100 && ros2 daemon stop && ros2 daemon start`.

### How are the manipulors being simulated?
> We implemeted a simple `MujocoHardwareInterface` to simulate the robots. This code is heavily inspired by the simulator in <a href="https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/cartesian_controllers/tree/ros2/cartesian_controller_simulation">cartesian_controllers</a>, but probably better alternatives to use mujoco as a backend simulation would be <a href="https://github.com/moveit/mujoco_ros2_control">mujoco_ros2_control</a>. One could also use gazebo. 
> The mujoco files come from the mujoco menagerie and have been slightly modified to use torque based actuators + we added some friction to the joints (to increase realism).
